**Homework 07**

This week, our task was to implement a costum LSTM model.



*Files:*

main.py : calls functions for data loading and preprocessing, runs LSTM model

load_data.py : Generator Function and Wrapper Generator, Splitting function and function for creating+splitting ds

data_pipeline.py : Datapipeline

lstm.py : Costum LSTM cell, layer and model

training.py : training loop

visualize.py : visualize training, test and validation results



Have fun!
